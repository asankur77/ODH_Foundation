                        <p class="mb-20">According to the World Health Organisation a health system consists of all organisations, people and actions whose primary intent is to promote, restore or maintain health. This includes efforts to influence determinants of health as well as more direct activities that improve health.</p>
                        <p class="mb-20">With a population of 142 Billion, last mile delivery of healthcare in our country has always been a challenge. Nearly 68% of the population lives in rural areas and has access to only about 35% of the healthcare infrastructure. On the other hand, The lack of basic healthcare affects everyone, especially urban slum dwellers are mostly a migrated population for whom livelihood challenges are overwhelming and thinking about healthcare is also a distant thing. </p>

                        <p class="mb-20">One of the primary focuses of the ODH Foundation is to initiate a quality medical care program in India for those who need it. We are committed to providing basic healthcare to the people of india. In order to achieve this monumental goal, we will work to improve conditions one community at a time. We believe the best way to increase awareness of health issues is through education. One of our current goals is to open an <b>100 Bed charitable hospital</b> and complement it by building <b>Charitable Public School</b> in different states of India for the better education of children. After all, children are the future of the country, and the best way to give them a bright future is to provide them with quality education. Education paves the way to increased awareness of good nutrition and sanitary practices, leading to improved quality of health, and eventually, to the ability to restore the staff of healthcare facilities with locally trained medical staff.</p>
                        <p class="mb-20">ODH Foundation through fully equipped mobile healthcare vans staffed with specialized doctors and paramedics, reaches out to hard-to-reach areas and provides OPD services, point-of-care testing facilities and medicines.</p>
