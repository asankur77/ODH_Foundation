                        <p class="mb-20">Art & Culture has an important contribution in the development of any country. It reflects shared vision, values, practices and a definite goal. Culture and creativity are included in all economic, social and other activities. With the aim of preserving India's rich heritage of art and culture as well as enhancing the livelihood opportunities of traditional artisans and craftsmen, ODH Foundation is constantly re-imagining ways to preserve and promote Indian Art & Culture. To support the arts in India is to support the millennia-long cultural traditions that make up our complex past, and the contemporary art practices that will inform our future. The creation of, and participation in, art is an important part of any community's development and a strong medium for its expression.</p>
                        <p class="mb-20">Rapid social changes are leading to rapid erosion of the country's rich and diverse heritage. India's monuments, museums and historical archives, which are living repositories of the country's heritage, are decaying mainly due to ignorance, lack of funds and expertise required to preserve them for future generations. The ODH Foundation supports efforts to document art and cultural heritage and preserve it for future generations. India is a land of diverse cultures and it is ODH Foundation's endeavour to ensure that the youth appreciate and connect with its rich heritage and arts. In line with its objective to protect and promote the art, culture and heritage of India, ODH Foundation undertakes various promotional and developmental projects and activities. As a cradle of great civilisations, India has a vast cultural heritage – including arts, crafts, music, dance and literature. It is an extraordinary heritage, thousands of years in the making. </p>

                        <p class="mb-20">ODH Foundation aims to provide a platform for Indian artists to showcase their talent and take their work to a wider audience through events. We are securing the future of endangered art forms by providing livelihood opportunities to traditional artists and craftsmen, ensuring that their work remains viable. We also support efforts to pass on India's cultural heritage to future generations. We are working to make Indian arts and culture more relevant to youth and help them appreciate and connect with their extraordinary heritage.</p>
