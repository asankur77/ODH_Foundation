                        <p class="mb-20">Urban Renewal is an economic development tool used by local governments across the country. More specifically, it is a method of economically revitalizing areas of “blight” through public investments that stimulate private development. Examples of blight include buildings that are unsafe or unfit for occupancy, inadequate streets, or environmentally contaminated areas. Due to these conditions, private real estate developers, property owners or business owners are unable to generate a sufficient profit on potential development in the area. As a result, private investment stalls and the blighted conditions remain.</p>
                        <p class="mb-20">Public investment is sometimes necessary to support and enable private investment. Public investments might include improving roads and infrastructure, technical and financial assistance to developers, or enhancing community amenities. Once private development becomes economically practical, investment returns to the area. As physical and economic conditions improve over time, further private investment is stimulated and the local economy is strengthened. The economic vitality, livability and environmental sustainability of the wider city are often improved by Urban Renewal investments. </p>
