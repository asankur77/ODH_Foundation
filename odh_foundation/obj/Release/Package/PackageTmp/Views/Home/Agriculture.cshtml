                        <p class="mb-20">India is a country where 70% of the rural population still relies on agriculture for their livelihood. With such a huge number of the population relying on agriculture, it is very important to promote the agricultural sector and bring innovations to it. ODH Foundation is trying to do just that.</p>
                        <p class="mb-20">Sustainable agriculture is far from mainstream in India, with most sustainable agricultural practices being practised by less than 2 - 4 per cent of all farmers, Land degradation and unsustainable agriculture practices have led to a loss of productivity which is fuelling rural poverty.In fact, agricultural productivity in India is among the lowest in the world.</p>
                             <p class="mb-20">The use of fertilizers, pesticides is resulting in soil erosion and posing a threat to the health of farmers and consumers. This is an issue at multiple levels and agriculture in the country's rain-fed areas is far less productive than in irrigated areas—with crop yields at a third of the national average. While farmers in irrigated areas earn 60 per cent of their income from agriculture, farmers in rain-fed areas earn only 25-30 per cent from agriculture-related activities.</p>

                         <p class="mb-20">ODH Foundation plans on developing an infrastructure that can be used by our farmers to grow and cultivate crops in the most effective and efficient manner. It plans on developing an independent mindset in our farmers regarding seed procurement, better irrigation and the overall development lifecycle of the corps. The collaboration with agricultural scientist will help ODH Foundation to bring about innovations in the field of agriculture which are not only affordable but also one of their kinds. ODH Foundation wants to lay the stone of never before seen agricultural innovations and become the best carrier of agricultural innovations not only for India but for the world.</p>

                        <p class="mb-20">ODH Foundation Increases Agricultural Productivity and Profitability; Makes agricultural practices climate resilient and nature friendly; and works with communities to prevent land degradation. Our climate resilient agriculture approach helps farmers reduce climate change risks, reduce farming costs, increase productivity and enhance their adaptability. As part of its counter measures, ODH Foundation is taking initiatives to focus on sustainable farming, where the use of organic inputs is maximized and also, methods used to market sustainable food through channels goes to those who give priority to it.</p>
