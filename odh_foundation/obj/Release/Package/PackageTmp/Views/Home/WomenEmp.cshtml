                        <p class="mb-20">Empowering women is essential to the health and social development of families, communities and countries. When women are living safe, fulfilled and productive lives, they can reach their full potential. Contributing their skills to the workforce and can raise happier and healthier children. A community, society, and country prosper when its women and girls are empowered. Giving women and girls the liberty and opportunity to have an education, be self-sufficient and financially independent, get the right healthcare, and have a say in decision-making at home and outside the home is beneficial for society. Even as we are witnessing women rising to the topmost political, bureaucratic, banking, and corporate positions, gender bias still prevents girls and women from rising to their highest potential. Gender equality prevents violence against women and girls. It's essential for economic prosperity. Societies that value women and men as equal are safer and healthier. Gender equality is a human right.</p>

Potential women entrepreneurs are identified and supported with dedicated programs to create an ecosystem for growth and excellence.</p>
