                        <p class="mb-20">Menstruation is a normal and healthy part of life for most women. Roughly half of the female population -- around 26 per cent of the global population -- are of reproductive age. Most women menstruate each month for about two to seven days. Yet, as normal as it is, menstruation is stigmatized around the world. </p>
                        <p class="mb-20">According to a survey and report conducted on the Girl Child, a girl is absent from school due to menses for 4 to 5 days in every 28 days (a month) thereby losing three weeks of learning every school term. A key finding pointed to something that no policy maker had previously identified.During menstruation, girls refused to go to school because there were no appropriate or adequate sanitation facilities. Because of the high cost of sanitary towels, girls from poor families continue to use unhygienic sponges, mattresses, tissue paper and even cotton– and most avoid school all together during their menstrual period.</p>
                             <p class="mb-20">Along with the lost learning days, girls, not surprisingly, lose self-confidence, and their chance of rising to the top of their class drops further each month.Although the sanitary pads have been exempted from ambit of GST, but still it is far way from the reach of women.According to NHFS report 50% of the women of India follow poor menstrual hygiene. Especially girl children and women who belong to rural areas are unaware of the infections caused by poor menstrual hygiene routine.Maintaining good menstrual hygiene is the need of the hours. Doing so can keep women away from fungal, bacterial and UTI (Urinary Tract Infections) at bay. Poor hygiene methods can also take them to severe cervical risks in the long run, moreover it can cause complications in pregnancy also.</p>

                        <p class="mb-20">ODH Foundation has taken the initiative to help poor girls who can not afford sanitary napkins. Free sanitary napkins will be distributed to rural girls specially girls studying in government schools.  Along with distributing sanitary pads to poor girls and women, we are trying to reach every nook and corner (mainly remote areas) so that we can spread awareness among women about health concerns, menstrual disorders and how easily they can stay away from it all.</p>
